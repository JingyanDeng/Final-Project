# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

remember me

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A simply memory game, give you a platform and you can flip different cards untill you get the same two patterns. Challenging for your memory.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software is a pygame that is like a little program. There are 6x6 cards, and you need to flip two cards. When you flip two cards with different patterns, the software will help you to flip these two cards back. Until you flip two cards with the same patterns, the software will leave these two cards and stay showing these two patterns. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

We're not planning to combine 1051's 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Partner:Xichen Mao, Partner's email:tuj86964@temple.edu, TA:Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

GOOD outcome is finish our code and run it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We will make sure the player can understand how to play this game and be able to flip any cards at the software.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We would like to make a ending by congratulate the player with dynamic firework. Then the next level will be harder than the previous level if the player pass.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We need to install pygame and learn how to use it. We need to research for information about pygame. I will work on how to make the card flip when the player click on the card and flip the cards back until player picking on the same patterns. Xichen will work on making the different patterns and make sure there's only two identical patterns in the game.
